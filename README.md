All the games here are hosted on my unblocked games website, [gn-math](https://gn-math.github.io), meant to be played online at school. If you have any suggestions for a game, join my [discord](https://discord.gg/D4c9VFYWyU)

I optimized a web-port of Deltarune made by Genizy to be compatible with playing on a browser, and I also added controls for people who are playing on Apple or Android device, you can still play the game on your pc with no Restrictions though I just made this open source because I know someone could make it look better.
